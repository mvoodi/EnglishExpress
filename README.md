Speech Recognition Game
This Python script is a simple speech recognition game that tests your language translation skills. It randomly selects a Russian word, translates it to English, and challenges you to pronounce the English word correctly. The game continues until you say "enough."

Prerequisites
Before running the script, make sure you have the required Python libraries installed:

pip install SpeechRecognition googletrans==4.0.0 langid
How to Play
Execute the script in a Python environment:

python main.py
The program will display a random Russian word, and you need to pronounce the English translation of that word.

To end the game, say "enough."

Important Notes
Make sure you have a working microphone connected to your device.

The script uses Google's speech recognition service, so an internet connection is required.

If the recognition fails, it will notify you, and you can try again.

Pay attention to the correct pronunciation; the script evaluates your response against the accurate English translation.

The game keeps track of your score, and the total score is displayed when you choose to end the game.

Have fun and improve your language skills!
